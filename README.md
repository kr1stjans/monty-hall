# Extended Monty Hall Problem

I am fascinated by the Monty Hall Problem [1], but its hard to prove it to others, because you need a lot of examples to truly see that its better to switch your initial choice. Therefore I made a webpage where you can visually simulate the problem with a few clicks and clearly see that it is better to switch your initial choice. The page is hosted on Github Pages: https://kr1stjans.github.io/monty-hall/
